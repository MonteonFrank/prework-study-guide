        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.</li>
        <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles</li>
        <li>Conditional statements is a way of introducing decision making into out cod and will only execute if the statement meets a condition</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. They are typically used to hold data that are related in some way.</li>
        <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data, they can store different types of data such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
        <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types</li>
        <li>This location is identified with a unique number called an index</li>
        <li>sing each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
        <li>A loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over again.</li>
        <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>A function is different from a loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when JavaScript is ran. </li>
        <li>Being able to call a function to execute also means we can control where the control flow of a task is executed or if its executed at all.         </li>
